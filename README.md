# SampleMvcCRUD

An ASP.NET Core MVC application demonstrating multiple approaches to implementing a modern, maintainable CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) user interface. This repository is designed as a reference and educational resource for developers interested in best practices for web application architecture, theming, API design, and deployment.
